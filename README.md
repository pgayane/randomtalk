RandomTalk
==========
RandomTalk is a small attampt to use sockets in python. Its has server and client which send each other random message from the message base which is included in the project as a text file.
Using RandomTalk you can see client and server having a discussion about the weather which might look like this:

<code>
Client: The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.<br />
Server: Because you can see the stars perfectly.<br />
Client: Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.<br />
Server: Because you can see the stars perfectly.<br />
Client: That is true. The weather is constantly changing.<br />
Server: Yes, I think so too.<br />
Client: It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.<br />
Server: I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.<br />
Client: It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend.<br />
Server: I like how clear the sky gets after it rains.<br />
Client: It's an ugly day today.<br />
Server: It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.<br />
Client: The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.<br />
Server: It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.<br />
Client: How come?<br />
Server: I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.<br />
Client: I feel the same way. It smells so good after it rains.<br />
Server: I really wish it wasn't so hot every day.<br />
Client: The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.<br />
Server: The stars look so much closer after it rains.<br />
Client: I think it will be.<br />
Server: Yeah, so do I.<br />
Client: I really want it to rain today.<br />
Server: Yeah, so do I.<br />
Client: How come?<br />
Server: That wouldn't seem right.
